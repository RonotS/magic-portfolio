## Introduction

The web was designed to be a platform for everyone, yet millions of people face barriers when accessing digital content. Accessibility in web development ensures that websites and applications can be used by **all users, including those with disabilities** such as vision, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments.  

Beyond being a best practice, accessibility is also a legal requirement in many regions and a ranking factor for search engines. More importantly, it’s about **inclusivity** — making sure no one is left out of the digital experience.  

This post explores why accessibility matters, the key principles behind it, and practical steps developers can take to make their projects compliant with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Equal Access:** Everyone should have the ability to navigate, interact with, and understand online content.  
- **Legal Compliance:** Regulations like the ADA (U.S.) and EN 301 549 (EU) mandate accessible digital experiences.  
- **SEO Benefits:** Accessible websites often perform better in search rankings due to improved structure and usability.  
- **Business Value:** By designing inclusively, you open your site to a larger audience and build stronger trust with users.

## WCAG Principles

WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) define four main principles, often summarized as **POUR**:  

1. **Perceivable** – Content must be presented in ways users can perceive (e.g., alt text for images).  
2. **Operable** – Interfaces must be easy to navigate and operate (e.g., keyboard-friendly navigation).  
3. **Understandable** – Information and UI should be clear and consistent.  
4. **Robust** – Content should work across different devices and assistive technologies.

## Practical Accessibility Techniques

### 1. Semantic HTML
Use proper elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<main>` , `<section>`, `<table>`, `<form>`, `<button>`) so assistive technologies can interpret structure correctly.  

```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="/home">My Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="/about">About Us</a></li>
                    <li><a href="/blog">Blog</a></li>
                    <li><a href="/contact">Contact Us</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>Content Area</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Form</h2>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Name</th>
                            <th>Role</th>
                            <th>Email</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                </table>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <form>
                <label>Name:</label><br />
                <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required /><br />

                <label for="message">Message:</label><br />
                <textarea id="message" name="message" rows="5" required></textarea><br />
                <button type="submit">Send</button>
            </form>
        </section>
    </main>
    </body>
    </html>
